        <p>The Colosseum today is a major tourist attraction in Rome with thousands of tourists each year entering to view the interior arena.[41] There is now a museum dedicated to Eros in the upper floor of the outer wall of the building. Part of the arena floor has been reinstated. Beneath the Colosseum, a network of subterranean passageways once used to transport wild animals and gladiators to the arena opened to the public in summer 2010.[42]

            The Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the 20th and 21st centuries. For instance, Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross (which calls for more meditation) at the Colosseum[43][44] on Good Fridays.[8]
